## About this repository
* Main goals of this repository:
  
    1. To test knowledge of how to create a REST API

    2. To tie together our newly created REST API/backend techniques and previous front end knowledge to create a static site.

## Lessons Learned
* How to create a REST API
* How to use Express Middleware packages (specifically the body-parser package)
* How to use AXIOS GET as well as other Front End techniques to load specific data on to a page
* How to use AXIOS POST to add data from the user to our server
* How to use AXIOS PATCH so the user can edit data from the page and then send it to the server with the updated data.
* jQuery --> more aesthetically pleasing to use $(document).on('click', "css selector", function) instead of $(document).onclick((e)=>{ if(e.target.id === ...)}) 

## Technology Used
* Node.js
* Express
* jQuery
* AXIOS
* Bootstrap
